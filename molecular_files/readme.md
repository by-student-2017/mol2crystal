The structure was drawn using the free version of ChemSketch, hydrogens were added using Avogadro, and the structure was optimized using GAFF. Then, the structure was optimized using MOPAC. Only the precursor mol of picene was obtained from a known pubchem. The case.mop is an example input file for structure optimization using MOPAC.
